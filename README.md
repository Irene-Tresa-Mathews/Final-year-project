Automated Varicose Vein Detection Using Faster R-CNN

# Abstract
Varicose veins are a common vascular issue that can lead to complications if not detected early. Traditional diagnostic methods are time-intensive and require specialized skills. This project proposes an automated approach using Faster R-CNN, a deep learning model, to detect and localize varicose veins from medical images. By leveraging transfer learning and a dataset of annotated images, the model achieves high accuracy in detecting affected areas. This method offers a non-invasive, efficient diagnostic tool, enhancing early detection and improving clinical outcomes.

# Problem Statement
Varicose veins are a common medical condition that affects a significant portion of the population, often leading to discomfort, pain, and other complications if left untreated. Traditional methods of detecting varicose veins rely heavily on manual examination and diagnostic imaging, which can be time-consuming, subjective, and dependent on the expertise of the medical professional. There is a need for a more efficient, accurate, and automated approach to detecting and analyzing varicose veins from medical images to reduce diagnosis time, increase accuracy, and support early treatment interventions.

# Proposed Solution
This project aims to develop an Automated Varicose Vein Detection System using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Faster R-CNN, to enhance the diagnostic process and provide real-time analysis and visualization of results.
